# hackaTUM-Project

Project Greenium:

This project uses a Browser-Extension that allows regular people to contribute to environmentaly important calculations by giving away their computational power.
We use a server in the backend that sends a mathematical "problem" to the client browser, then the client browser answers with the solution. Like this we are able to use the computational power of millions in order to help system critial research.

This repository is used as a proof of concept / demo.
